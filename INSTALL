NOTE:  This is the CVS HEAD version of the DXR3 plugin.  It is currently not
       ready for general consumption; for example OSD is missing.  You
       probably want to use the vdr-dxr3-0-2 branch instead.  Check out that
       branch with:
       cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/dxr3plugin \
         co -r vdr-dxr3-0-2 dxr3

Prerequisites:

Installation:

- Get the latest dxr3-plugin version from
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/dxr3plugin/
