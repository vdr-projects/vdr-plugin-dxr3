Known problems, bugs, and workarounds for this driver:
------------------------------------------------------

* The MP3 plugin's "show live TV" option while playing stuff doesn't work.
  Workaround: none known, but the black screen isn't that bad if you
  make the MP3 progress stuff/playlist visible...

* No sound with the DVD plugin with VDR >= 1.3.18.
  Workaround: use the MPlayer plugin to play DVDs.
  Workaround 2: use VDR < 1.3.18.

* VCD plugin does not work.
  Workaround: use the MPlayer plugin to play VCDs.

* VDR crashes at exit.
  Workaround: none known.  Unless you want to try to debug it (which you're
  most welcome to do, obviously!), you probably don't want core dumps all
  over your disk.  Disable them with eg. "ulimit -c 0" in the environment
  you run VDR in.

* When cutting recordings from some channels, the still picture is stuck
  and won't move when you press 4 or 6 to fine tune the cutmarks.
  Workaround: see vdr-iframe.patch in the patches/ directory.

* If the TV aspect ratio does not automatically adjust according to the
  video stream, and you have a ADV7170-based DXR3 and a PAL system, see
  em8300-adv7170-wss.patch and vdr-dxr3-wss.patch in the patches/ dir.

* The TVOnscreen plugin's OSD is a mess, positioning errors etc.
  Workaround: use TVOnscreen < 0.6.0.  0.5.2 works fine for me (Ville).

* After invoking the "Reset DXR3 hardware" function, OSD goes pink
  until it's hidden and shown again.

Other TODOs:
------------

* set bcs
* clean unneeded log entries
* stillpicture
* grab screenshot
* add much more comments!
* rewrite some parts of plugin like 
	- demuxer
	- palettemanger
	- colormanger
	- spuencoder
* osd via
	- ffmpeg
	- vga overlay

* optimize (is it worth it?)
	Rgb2YCrCb
	YUV2Rgb
