Troubleshooting, known problems, bugs, and workarounds related to this driver:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* There's no sound.
  Workaround (well, not really a workaround because in the vast majority
  of cases this is not a problem with the plugin): check that the version of
  ffmpeg's libavcodec that the plugin uses at runtime is the same or /really/
  compatible one that you compiled it with.  One simple but perhaps a
  draconian way to do this is to ensure that you have exactly one version of
  ffmpeg/libavcodec installed, remove extra ones if needed, rebuild the
  plugin, and try again.

* The MP3 plugin's "show live TV" option while playing stuff doesn't work.
  Workaround: none known, but the black screen isn't that bad if you
  make the MP3 progress stuff/playlist visible...

* VCD plugin does not work.
  Workaround: use the MPlayer plugin to play VCDs.

* No sound with the DVD plugin with VDR >= 1.3.18.
  Workaround: use the MPlayer plugin to play DVDs.
  Workaround 2: use VDR < 1.3.18.
  Workaround 3: patches/vdr-dxr3-ac3.patch may work for you.

* When cutting old recordings (made with VDR < 1.3.28 or something, newer
  ones should not be affected) from some channels, the still picture is
  stuck and won't move when you press 4 or 6 to fine tune the cutmarks.
  Workaround: apply Reinhard Nißl's dvbplayer patch for VDR, see
  http://home.vr-web.de/~rnissl/vdr-1.3.28-dvbplayer.patch

* If the TV aspect ratio does not automatically adjust according to the
  video stream, and you have a ADV7170-based DXR3 and a PAL system, see
  em8300-adv7170-wss.patch and vdr-dxr3-wss.patch in the patches/ dir.

Other TODOs:
------------

* set bcs
* clean unneeded log entries
* stillpicture
* grab screenshot
* add much more comments!
* rewrite some parts of plugin like 
	- demuxer
	- palettemanger
	- colormanger
	- spuencoder
* osd via
	- ffmpeg
	- vga overlay
* optimize (is it worth it?)
	Rgb2YCrCb
	YUV2Rgb
* use xine OSD scaler unconditionally
