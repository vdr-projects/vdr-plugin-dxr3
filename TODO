Known problems, bugs, and workarounds for this driver:
------------------------------------------------------

* The MP3 plugin's "show live TV" option while playing stuff doesn't work.
  Workaround: none known, but the black screen isn't that bad if you
  make the MP3 progress stuff/playlist visible...

* VCD plugin does not work.
  Workaround: use the MPlayer plugin to play VCDs.

* When cutting recordings from some channels, the still picture is stuck
  and won't move when you press 4 or 6 to fine tune the cutmarks.
  Workaround: see vdr-iframe.patch in the patches/ directory.

* If the TV aspect ratio does not automatically adjust according to the
  video stream, and you have a ADV7170-based DXR3 and a PAL system, see
  em8300-adv7170-wss.patch and vdr-dxr3-wss.patch in the patches/ dir.

* The TVOnscreen plugin's OSD is a mess, positioning errors etc.
  Workaround: use TVOnscreen < 0.6.0.  0.5.2 works fine for me (Ville).

Other TODOs:
------------

* set bcs
* clean unneeded log entries
* stillpicture
* grab screenshot
* add much more comments!
* rewrite some parts of plugin like 
	- demuxer
	- palettemanger
	- colormanger
	- spuencoder
* osd via
	- ffmpeg
	- vga overlay

* optimize (is it worth it?)
	Rgb2YCrCb
	YUV2Rgb
