VDR Plugin 'dxr3' Revision History
----------------------------------

2002-08-04: Version 0.0.1

- Initial revision.

2002-11-10: Version 0.1.0

- Rewritten Audio/Video-sync engine
- Changed OSD colors (but still limited to four colors)

2002-11-12: Version 0.1.1

- Changed Makefile (needed for vdr 1.1.15)
- The plugin should now work smoother under heavy system load (e.g. network traffic)

2002-12-23: Version 0.1.2
- Compiles now with gcc3.2.
- Fixed unsigned / signed bug in output thread (dxr3outputthread.c) which led
to sporadic resync (still frame and jump of about 1s).
- OSD is now as colorful as vdr with DVB-s
- OSD rescaling for channels with a lower horizontal resolution

2002-12-29: Version 0.1.3
- SPU write is now protected with a mutex by using the Dxr3AbstractionDevice.
- Fixed horizontal size detection.
- Added usleep call during still picture to reduce cpu load.
- Removed calls to WaitForSysClock in dxr3outputthread.c which led to problems
during replay on some systems (Thanks to Atte Manninen for reporting this).
- Did some minor changes to dxr3outputthread.c which hopefully will increase
reliability.
- Changed osd scale rule. Scaling now only happens if the horizontal size is
smaller than 700.

2003-01-05: Version 0.1.4
- Small bugfix in dxr3demuxdevice.c

2003-02-19: Version 0.1.5
- Support for MP3 plugin.
- Support for radio channels. Requested by Richard P. (???) who send me a
  sample code ... thanks.
- Some fixes to get along with corrupt pes data (which should actually be
  solved in a lower layer). Thanks to Teemu Rantanen.
- Changed sync buffer size during replay to reduce "jumps" in cutted streams.
  Thanks to Atte Manninen for the idea.
- Support for still frame handling. Now it is possible to move the editing
  marks with visible corresponding i-frames. Unfortunately this doesn't seem to
  work with finish dvb streams.
- Some tuning to reduce cpu load during replay.

2003-02-25: Version 0.1.6
- Added black frames between channel switches (which solves the frozen picture 
  'problem' when using the mp3-plugin, too).
- Increased thread priority of output threads which improves live stream
  quality on my system (K6II 350).

2003-03-23: Version 0.1.7
- Added unix domain server interface to close and reopen dxr3 devices without
  stopping vdr (see dxr3_ux_client.pl script on how to use this).
  Requested by Atte Manninen.
  Thanks to Atte Manninen and Teemu Rantanen for testing and fixing some problems.
- Added support for external player mode.
- Some cosmetic changes.
- Some changes to reduce cpu load.
- Added workaround handling for osd crash (driver patch necessary; patch with
  em8300_patch.diff).
  Thanks to Teemu Rantanen and Malcolm Caldwell for testing this.
- Added buffered output for mp3-plugin audio data. This seems to improve audio
  quality significantly.
- Reduced count of audio errors (wrong data rate).
- Changed channel switch behavior (to remove audio disturbances => channel switching
  is a little bit slower now).
- Added exception handling for defect pes streams.
- Added more checks by introducing a new pes parsing class.
- Fixed buffer overrun problem. Because of the missing pll control a buffer overrun
  happens after staying for a long time on the same channel. In older version
  the output stopped after a buffer overrun. Now the buffer will be cleared and
  the output will continue after about a second.
- New buffer handling in PlayVideo.

2003-03-23: Version 0.1.7a
- Bugfix in A/V-engine for audio output with less dropouts

2003-04-28: Version 0.1.8
- Added support for dvd-plugin (subtitles doesn't work properly so far).
- Added setup parameter to define the dxr3-card which shall be used  by vdr
  (thanks to Tobias Haustein).
- Added setup parameter to force letter box mode (for wrong aspect ratio coded
  in pes-stream). This parameter is not saved.
- Added support for video format setup parameter (no WSS support).
- Fixed external player support (thanks to Seppo Ingalsuo).
- Added volume support (thanks to Teemu Rantanen).
- Fixed I-Frame display problem (cutting and fast forward/backwards in some streams).
  Those who have problems with fast forward/backward might want to patch
  vdr (use vdr_iframe_patch.diff / for vdr-1.1.29).
- Reduced memory consumption.
- Fixed problem with digital output setup parameter.
- Fixed wrong bit error detection.
- Changed bit error handling.

2003-04-28: Version 0.1.8a
- Second trial to fix external player support (thanks to Jarkko Santala)

2003-05-07: Version 0.1.9
- Added support for AC3 streams (based on classes of
  the AC3overDVB Patch maintained by Stefan Huelswitt).
- Added DXR3 main menu entry. It's now possible to:
    - Reset DXR3-hardware.
    - Toggle Force LetterBox.
    - Switch to Digital Output.
    - Switch to AC3 Output (when already listening to digital output).
- Added short ac3 information text on channel switch.
- Reduced analog audio disturbances.
- Fixed audio initialization problem.

2003-05-07: Version 0.2.0
- Fixed compatibility problem with vdr version 1.1.31 and higher.
- Fixed analog audio problem (spurious disturbances).
- Added first cut mpeg1 support: It works quite good with vcd plugin. As far as I know
  this doesn't work reliable together with analog plugin. Thanks to Gavin Hamill for
  testing support and investigations with analog plugin.
  No osd scaling for mpeg1 at the moment.
- Changed channel switch behavior with respect to mpeg1 support (it doesn't seem
  to be possible to switch between mpeg1 and mpeg2 without closing and reopening the
  video device).
- Improved lib sync.

2003-08-10: Version 0.2.1
- Added setup entry to switch between ntsc and pal. This setting becomes active
  after restarting vdr and reseting the dxr3 card, respectively.
- Fixed uninitialized variable m_audioMode in dxr3abstractiondevice.c. Thanks 
  to Jon Burgess.
- Fixed incorrect ioctl-problem. Thanks to Jon Burgess.
- Fixed wrong scaled osd problem when starting vdr without live stream.
- Fixed external player problem when return to dxr3 output after using ac3 output.
  Thanks to Jarkko Santala for reporting this one.
- Fixed wrong assert-call. Thanks to Andre Neumann.

2004-01-04: Version 0.2.2

- Some initialization fixes. Thanks to Jon Burgess.
- Added patch from Teemu Rantanen to emergency exit if
  the plugin is not able to recover from dxr3 driver crash.
- Fixed some osd problems (Elchi, Games, etc.).
- Changed Makefile to support vdr-1.3.0.

2004-06-22: Version 0.2.3-alpha1 (only for vdr-portal.de)

- we are using now <linux/em8300.h> instead of "em8300.h"
- updated multichannelaudio.h/c with newest AC3overDVB-Patch-Source (0.2.6)
- switched to new osd routines for vdr-1.3.7
- added dxr3singleton.h
- new interface to work with ffmpeg (chagned include to <avcodec.h>)
- added a lot of commments and cosmetic code cleanups
- using everywhere std::string - makes life nicer
- moved dxr3absdevice to dxr3interface
- rewritten some parts of dxr3interface
- added anti-glinsch-when-fast-forward-and-then-play-patch ;)
- killed DIAG and added a global logger, which is used only in
  a few functions and not in every like DIAG
- removed cDxr3StatusMonitor - i dont know why we need this
- cleaned out unneeded includes
- fixed memory leak in cDxr3Interface::UploadMicroCode:
  If uploading of the microcode failed, the allocated memory wasn't
  freed.
- If we are changing the audiooutput now the plugin will call an overworked
  AudioRepoen function, which does not shutdown the whole card.
- Things like VIDEOMODE and AUDIOMODE are now set only ONCE on plugin start!
- added check if memory in cDxr3SyncBuffer is allocated correct
- introced a 'ToDo-System'.
  in every *.c file there can be something like this at the top of the file:
  /*
	ToDo:
		- cDxr3SyncBuffer::Push: XXX This is only a workaround until a sufficient control algorithm is implemented
  */

  So it is easier to keep track of stuff, which needs more work.
- some small changes in dxr3colormanger.h/c
- some small changes in dxr3pesframe.h/c
- some small changes in spuenc.h/c
- killed spu_dump in spuenc.h/c
- renamed spuenc.h/c to dxr3interface_spu_encoder.h/c
- changed dxr3audiodecoder to support the new ffmpeg interface
- renamed dxr3absspu/dxr3absspulist to dxr3interace_spu/dxr3interace_spu_list
- volume control logarithmic instead of linear. 
  This is a more natural sounding way of controlling the 
  volume. Thanks to Jon Burgess <mplayer@jburgess.uklinux.net>
- added patch for DVD subtitles. Thanks to Stuart Daines <s.daines@ntlworld.com>
- fixed memory leak in dxr3osd.c - Thanks to Miika Pekkarinen <miipekk@ihme.org>
- added Tools namespace, which has a fixed Rgb2YCrCb function in it (dxr3tools.h)
- kicked out Cmd in dxr3osd.h/c
- added dxr3i18n.h/c
- added Portuguese language support - thanks to Paulo Lopes <pmml@netvita.pt>
- added Finnish language support - thanks to Hannu Savolainen <hannu@opensound.com>
- added Swedish language support - thanks to Tomas Prybil <tomas@prybil.se>
NOTE: I havent found time to include all of the languages, will be done in pre2
- kicked out - i hope - some unneeded usleeps
- rewrote cSPUEncoder: Now we imitate the Cmd funtion form the dvb drivers. So
  we can use now the normal osd functions form dvbosd.c :)
- added support for vdr-1.3.11
- added videomode pal 60


2004-07-29: Version 0.2.3-pre2 (now aviable on SourceForge)

- fixed audio and video problems
- works now with vdr < 1.3.7
- added YUV2Rgb int dxr3tools.h (for dxr3spudecoder)
- added some more debug infos in dxr3outputthread.c
- added const keyword in dxr3configdata.h
- added EM8300 include define in Makefile
- added debuglevels, so we can define how much we want to log
- assimilated spudecoder from vdr's dvbspu.c/h -> nice nav in dvds
- kicked out cDxr3InterfaceSpu from dxr3interface.c/h
- a little fix for cDxr3Interface::ResampleVolume
- kicked out dxr3interface_spu.c/h and dxr3interface_spu_list.c/h, because
  the new spudecoder dont need it anymore.
- added dxr3cpu.c/h to get some infos about the cpu
- added dxr3memcpy.c/h to get a little speedup - i hope
- maybe a little audiofix: lastHeader in cDxr3AudioDecoder will now set to 0
  with the constr. and not via Init()-function. So there should be now some lesser
  audio scratches.
- osd works now on every resolution (viva, viva plus,...)
- added main-menu-entry
- added in some parts some memory allocation tests
- added fix for Makefile from vdr-portal.de -> should compile on more machines :)
- added Tools::WriteInfoToOsd(...) - now some infos like "Releasing devices" are show
  now on the osd again
- fixed dxr3osd_subpicutre.c - thanks to Paavo Hartikainen <pahartik@sci.fi>


2004-??-??: Version 0.2.3-pre3

- fixed output of anamorphic video, if tv aspect is configured to 16:9 in DVB setup menu 
  thanks Seppo Ingalsuo <seppo.ingalsuo@iki.fi>
- rewrote i18n support
- fixed void cDxr3Interface::SetAudioDigitalPCM() - thanks to Stephan Skrodzki <skrodzki@contcast.de> for patch
- dxr3memcpy.c/h: fix to support older compilers like gcc-2.95
  Here i want to thanks  Marco Schlüßler very much for run compil tests, even he
  dont run the plugin :)
- dxr3memcpy.c/h: should now compile on alpha and powerpc - thanks to Paavo Hartikainen <pahartik@sci.fi>
- added many comments into source
- using doxygen for docs
- cDxr3Interface::ConfigureDevice(): we get now videomode from driver and set only a 
  new one, if the wanted one is different to the driver defaults one.
- added functions to read and write registers directly with the plugin
- added basic dolby digital interface
- you can configure microcode path in Makefile - thanks to Sascha Volkenandt <sascha@akv-soft.de>
- fixed DVBDIR and FFMDIR in Makefile - thanks to guys from www.vdr-wiki.de
- you can set now logpath in makefile
  You should also run a linke like 
  # find / -name "dxr3plugin.log" | xargs rm
  because the pre2 seems to put this dxr3plugin.log random in some folders  - reporded by Martin Dauskardt <md001@gmx.de>
- extended cDxr3MemcpyBench::Rdtsc(uint32_t config_flags)
  support for non x86 arch
  support for cpu's, which dont support rdtsc timing
- logger now thread safe
- rewrote cDxr3SpuDecoder
  dropped software decoder
  added hardware decoder, so we make use of DVD-functions of the dxr3
- checked Lock() and Unlock() in dxr3interface.c - hope everything is ok else contact me
- using now std:: instead of namespace std;
