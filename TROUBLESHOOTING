Troubleshooting, known problems, bugs, and workarounds related to this driver:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* There's no sound.
  Workaround (well, not really a workaround because in the vast majority
  of cases this is not a problem with the plugin): check that the version of
  ffmpeg's libavcodec that the plugin uses at runtime is the same or /really/
  compatible one that you compiled it with.  One simple but perhaps a
  draconian way to do this is to ensure that you have exactly one version of
  ffmpeg/libavcodec installed, remove extra ones if needed, rebuild the
  plugin, and try again.

* The MP3 plugin's "show live TV" option while playing stuff doesn't work.
  Workaround: none known, but the black screen isn't that bad if you
  make the MP3 progress stuff/playlist visible...

* VCD plugin does not work.
  Workaround: use the MPlayer plugin to play VCDs.

* No sound with the DVD plugin with VDR >= 1.3.18.
  Workaround: use the MPlayer plugin to play DVDs.
  Workaround 2: use VDR < 1.3.18.

* When cutting old recordings (made with VDR < 1.3.28 or something, newer
  ones should not be affected) from some channels, the still picture is
  stuck and won't move when you press 4 or 6 to fine tune the cutmarks.
  Workaround: apply Reinhard Nißl's dvbplayer patch for VDR, see
  http://home.vr-web.de/~rnissl/vdr-1.3.28-dvbplayer.patch

* If the TV aspect ratio does not automatically adjust according to the
  video stream, and you have a ADV7170-based DXR3 and a PAL system, see
  em8300-adv7170-wss.patch and vdr-dxr3-wss.patch in the patches/ dir.

* OSD instability, flicker, tearing colors etc can in some cases to some
  extent be reduced by using (increasing) the OSD flush rate option in
  plugin settings.  For many people, using the skinelchi plugin or the
  text2skin plugin with the enElchi skin has been reported to work much
  better than other skins (even with OSD flush rate set to 0).

* If VDR becomes unresponsive when using the MP3 or Muggle plugins, or
  there are stuttering/stickiness problems with the DVD plugin, and
  you're using a NPTL system, try disabling NPTL if possible (eg.
  export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.19 before starting VDR).  NPTL cannot be
  disabled on all systems, and anyway it would be very nice if someone
  found what the problem is, and would submit a patch.

* Wide screen signaling (WSS) requires patching the em8300 driver, and
  probably works only with ADV7170, see patches/em8300-adv7170-wss.patch
  and http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.vdr/17095

Other (some possibly stale) TODOs:
----------------------------------

* set bcs
* clean unneeded log entries
* stillpicture
* grab screenshot
* add much more comments!
* rewrite some parts of plugin like 
	- demuxer
	- palettemanger
	- colormanger
	- spuencoder
* osd via
	- ffmpeg
	- vga overlay
* optimize (is it worth it?)
	Rgb2YCrCb
	YUV2Rgb
* use xine OSD scaler unconditionally
